# Engage's counciltag the game

## The beginning
This began as a create-react-app, was ejected, used different styles, and just plain changed things.
Now it lets you add necessary information to all the council tags and get points for new hats and accoutrements (so what if there are no accoutrements yet, you'll still be stylish)!

## The future
- A leader board showing all the most prolific and correct taggers!
- More hats
- Actual accoutrements
- Refine what it means to be a "correct" tagging
- Change colors to match colorscheme of Engage's other projects

## What we do with your data
- We are building a dataset to train/improve our ML models with and the more taggers with their own views the better!
- What we do with your username and stuff: 
  - Nothing! We just use it to keep track of your points and put your username on the leaderboard
